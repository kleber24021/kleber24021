- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kleber24021, I'm a 21 year old student of multiplatform programming. I'm still learning how to program, so my code it's not very good.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in videogames, of course, but also in computers, mountain bike, paddle tennis and my dog.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java, Python and Kotlin. Although I'm interested in almost anything related and I investigate deeper about anything I learn or discover.
